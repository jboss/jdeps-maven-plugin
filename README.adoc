[id='jdeps-maven-plugin']
= JDeps Maven Plugin
:toc: macro

This Maven plugin allows you to quickly print out the dependencies of your project by package, module, or class.

[id='get-started']
== Get Started

To quickly print out the dependencies for your project, use this command:

```
mvn org.jboss.maven.plugins:jdeps-maven-plugin:RELEASE:jdeps
```

If you get an error about multi-release JARs, you'll have to add the multi-release JAR flag like so:

```
mvn org.jboss.maven.plugins:jdeps-maven-plugin:RELEASE:jdeps -Djdeps.multiRelease=base
```

Note that versions of Java before 12 may be _very_ intolerant of mixing multi-release JARs with "regular" JARs.  This
has been improved somewhat in Java 12 and later.

[id='usage-jdeps']
== Usage: `jdeps` Mojo

This mojo is mainly intended to be executed directly from the command line and probably isn't too useful to include in
a project.  There are several configuration properties which can be used to customize the analysis:

[cols=4*,options="header"]
|===
|Property Name
|Default
|Valid values
|Description

|`jdeps.classesDir`
|`${project.build.outputDirectory}`
|Any directory or archive
|The directory where the build output class files may be found.

|`jdeps.dot.output`
|none
|A (possibly non-existent) directory name
|Directs the `jdeps` utility to output GraphViz-style `dot` diagrams in the given directory.

|`jdeps.filter`
|`archive`
|`archive`
  `module`
  `package`
  `none`
|The level at which self-dependencies should be filtered out.

|`jdeps.filter.pattern`
|none
|A valid regex
|A filter that excludes any matching class name from analysis.

|`jdeps.ignoreMissing`
|`false`
|`false`
  `true`
|Set to ignore missing dependencies.  Only support on Java 12 or higher.

|`jdeps.limit.pattern`
|none
|A valid regex
|A pattern to apply to determine what classes to include in analysis.

|`jdeps.limit.packages`
|none
|A comma-separated list of package names
|A list of package names to include in analysis.  Ignored if `jdeps.limit.pattern` is given.

|`jdeps.limit.modules`
|none
|A comma-separated list of module names
|A list of module names to include in analysis.  Ignored if `jdeps.limit.pattern` or `jdeps.limit.packages` is given.

|`jdeps.multiRelease`
|none
|A release number or `base`
|Set to enable multi-release JAR support.  Note that mixing MR JARs with regular JARs is not supported before Java 12.

|`jdeps.outputFile`
|none
|A file name
|Send the output to this file instead of printing it on `stdout`.

|`jdeps.transitive`
|`false`
|`false`
  `true`
|Set to include transitive dependencies in the report.  The output may be large.

|`jdeps.verbose`
|`package`
|`summary`
  `package`
  `class`
|The verbosity level of the output.

[id='usage-jdeps']
== Usage: `jdeps-find-cycles` Mojo

This mojo will find cycles among the graph output.  Like `jdeps`, this mojo is intended to be executed from the command line.

A good strategy is to use the `jdeps` mojo to get the output you want, and then run `jdeps-find-cycles` with the same properties.
Note that the `jdeps.outputFile` and `jdeps.dot.output` properties are ignored by this mojo; the other properties are supported.
